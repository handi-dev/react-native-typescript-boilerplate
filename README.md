## Requirements

Node 18 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up, and will target iOS 11 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.  
Go to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  
Follow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.

## Quick start

To create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :

```
npx react-native init MyAppName --template @handidev/react-native-typescript-boilerplate
```

note: replace `MyAppName` with your desired App name.

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn start` / `npm start -- -- reset-cache`  to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `npx react-native run-ios` / `npx react-native run-android`  to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)
## List of Q & A

#### I got error `Error: spawn ./gradlew EACCES` when run `npx react-native run-android`.

Run this command `chmod 755 android/gradlew` from your root project directory

#### I got error `Error: SDK location not found. Define location with sdk.dir in the local.properties file or with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable.`

- Go to your Project -> Android
- Create a file local.properties
- Open the file
- Paste your Android SDK path depending on the operating system:

  - Windows:
    sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\`USERNAME`\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk
  - Linux or MacOS
    sdk.dir=/Users/`USERNAME`/Library/Android/sdk

- Replace `USERNAME` with your PC username


#### Error Your Ruby version is 2.6.10, but your Gemfile specified 2.7.5
- install `rbenv`
- run `rbenv local 2.7.5`
- `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"`
`export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"`
